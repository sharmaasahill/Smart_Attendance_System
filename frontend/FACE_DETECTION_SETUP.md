- **Corner Brackets** - Professional-looking corner markers on detected faces
- **Scanning Line Effect** - Moving green line across detected faces
- **Cross-hair Targeting** - Center cross-hair for precise alignment
- **HUD Display** - Security system status overlay
- **Confidence Percentage** - Shows detection accuracy (75-98%)
- **Animated Status Chips** - "AI SECURITY SYSTEM" and "TARGET LOCKED" indicators

### 🔧 Technical Features
- **Real-time Detection** - 7 FPS face detection simulation
- **Smart Grid Overlay** - Scanning grid when no face detected
- **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes
- **Multiple Detection Modes** - Different behavior for capture vs attendance
- **Enhanced UI** - Gradient backgrounds, glowing borders, animations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Built-in Simulation (Recommended)
The system works immediately with a sophisticated **face detection simulation** that:
- Provides realistic detection behavior (80% detection rate)
- Shows confidence percentages (75-98%)
- Creates animated detection boxes and effects
- Requires no additional setup

### Option 2: Real Face Detection (Advanced)
For actual face detection, install face-api.js models:

```bash
# Install the package
npm install face-api.js

# Create models directory
mkdir public/models

# Download models from:
# https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights
```
